## Main objectives:
- [x] Build my own blog website in a way that can express myself.
- [x] The index page must include my unique design.

## Optional objectives:
- [x] Images are not in the representation of the index page.
- [x] Index page is in a big picture fashion.

<br/>

## Features I haven't been anticipating:
-    Animations for menu.
-    Animations for tag buttons.
-    A layout for post page.

<br/>

### Todo:
- [ ] Redesign left side into a navigating style from which advantages like rich visual and open layout can be gained.
